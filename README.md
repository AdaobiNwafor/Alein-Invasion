# Alein-Invasion
Python code for Alien Invasion game. 

This is a working **Python Game**. This was my **introduction to pygame** and **working with sprites**. After taking several python courses, **Experimenting with Classes and Functions** was interesting as well as learning about the pygame syntax and how to organize the code. 

There are many different parts to making this project and it was fun and exciting working through it.
